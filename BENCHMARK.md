Perfect, this is golden data for your **Akash official website**. You can frame it as **proof of performance and stability under load**. Here’s what you should include and how:

---

### 1️⃣ **Throughput / Requests per Second**

* Highlight the load Akash can handle:

  > **“Akash successfully handled 500,000 requests with 200 concurrent clients, achieving \~74,600 requests per second.”**
* This directly communicates **high performance / scalability**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Latency / Response Time**

* Show latency distribution to demonstrate **speed and consistency**:

  * Average: 2.6 ms
  * 50th percentile: 2.1 ms
  * 95th percentile: 6.6 ms
  * Max: 150 ms
* Present it visually, like a **latency histogram**, similar to your `hey` report.

Example text:

> “Median response time of 2.1ms under high concurrency. 95% of requests served in under 6.6ms.”

---

### 3️⃣ **Stability**

* Status codes: all **200 OK**
* Emphasize **no dropped requests**:

  > “Zero failed requests under sustained load of 500k requests.”

---

### 4️⃣ **Concurrency / Stress Handling**

* Mention the **200 concurrent connections** test:

  > “Built to handle hundreds of simultaneous clients efficiently with minimal latency.”

---

### 5️⃣ **Raw Data / Transparency**

* Consider adding a **link or downloadable report** of the load test (JSON / CSV) for enthusiasts.

---

### 6️⃣ **Optional: Graphs**

* Use **bar graphs or histograms**:

  * Requests per second
  * Latency percentiles (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%)
* Visual proof increases credibility.

### ✅ Suggested Website Section

**Performance:**

> Akash is optimized for speed and scalability. In benchmarks with 200 concurrent clients and 500,000 total requests:
>
> * **Requests/sec:** \~74,600
> * **Median latency:** 2.1 ms
> * **95th percentile latency:** 6.6 ms
> * **Total data served:** 20 MB
> * **Success rate:** 100% (no failed requests)

> These results demonstrate Akash’s ability to handle heavy traffic while maintaining ultra-low latency.

If you want, I can **mock a ready-to-paste section for your website** with a nice histogram + bullet points, so it looks professional and “techy.”

Do you want me to do that?
